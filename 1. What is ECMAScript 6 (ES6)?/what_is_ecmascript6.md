## What is ECMAScript 6
* Let's talk about the history of JavaScript.
    * JavaScript was **initially** released in 1995 by **Brendan Ike** at **Netscape**(Web browser). Then it was **adopted** by **Microsoft** as **JScript**.
    * At first there were different versions of JavaScript for different browsers. From here a **need** for **standardization** has appeared.
    * **ECMA** refers to **European Computer Manufacturer Association** which is the organization responsible for this **standardization**.
    * First, **ES1** was released in 1997.
    * Then **ES2**, **ES3**, and **ES4** were also released but with **no big sensation**(widespread reaction).
    * Then **ES5** were released in 2009.
    * And finally **ES6** was released in 2015 with great features.

## ES6 Browser Support
* **ES6** is not yet supported by all browsers or at least not all ES6 features are supported by all browsers. For that purpose we can not use ES6 alone. We should use a tool to **transpile** ES6 into ES5 when the browser does not support it.

## Using ES6 now
* **Transpiling** is the process of converting ES6 code into ES5 so that it can be read by browsers which do not support ES6 yet.
* We do not use **transpiling** only with **JavaScript** but also with **CoffeeScript** and **TypeScript**.   
* There are many **transpiling tools** out there:
    * **Babel**(the most popular).
    * **Traceur**.
    * **Closure**.
    * and more.
* For **testing** we can use **Chrome Canary**(the version of Chrome that is currently in development. It is not stable but it supports many new features).
