## Comment on the course
* I do not much recommend this course for a few reasons:
    * There are no projects at all.
    * The examples are very silly.
    * The instructor does not clarify things well. Frequently, you need to do a lot of search to get to the point.
* However, if you decided to go with, and make some effort on search, You will benefit much as I did.
* At overall, the course is not bad.
