## Welcome
* **ECMAScript** is the specifications that JavaScript adheres or conforms to. It tells the browser how to interpret JavaScript code.
* **Specifications** are a set of points that guides describing and identifying something.
* In this course we will study **ES6(ECMAScript 6 or ECMAScript 2015) which is a later version of **ECMAScript**.
* Precisely, we will look in ES6 at the following:
    * new features.
    * new keywords and operators that can be used to simplify code.
    * new functions and objects syntax that help us manage scope and readability.
    * class syntax and how that can be used with **React**(The popular JS library).

## What you should know
* Before diving in this course, you should:
    * have basic knowledge of JavaScript.
    * be familiar with HTML and CSS.
* We will encounter a bit of **React.js** and **Node.js**. However, you can start the course with zero knowledge about them.
